# Sparta Global Academy Homework - Creating My website

## Project Review:##

### In this project I had to use the skills learnt over the course of the week to produce a webpage. Using the features we have learnt such as, navigation tools, responsiveness and structuring the layout of the website.

## Using CSS tools such as:
```css
.class {container-fluid}
.jumbotron{}

.container{}
```

## Using these tools enabled me to change the layout of the website according to how I planned my design. Creating a container allowed information to be in a structure format. Once the layout is set, it was possible to add images to the page.
